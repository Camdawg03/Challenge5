<h2>My most recent obsession: 2/10/25</h2>
<p>So back when I was around 13/14 years old, I collected a few Pokemon cards. This was back when the B&W era was fading out and the X&Y era was beginning. I remember my first ever rare card was a full art Yveltal EX from that X&Y set. I instantly fell in love with how beautiful the artwork was and how intricate the patterns of the rare cards are. I “made” my grandma (who spoiled me senseless) buy me packs all the time, and I was only interested in collecting, not playing. After a few years, it got too expensive and I stopped collecting, but kept some of my cards. Now, in 2025, I’m an adult with adult money and suddenly getting back into collecting. I recently calculated what my current collection is worth and turns out, some of those cards I kept from when I collected years ago are worth $100+ now. My entire collection with some recently collected cards is worth roughly $677, not bad. I plan on going to some card stores and conventions soon once I get some more fun money and expanding my collection. There are so many sets and rare cards now, I really don’t know what to look for, so I’m just going to collect and buy the cards I think have the coolest artwork. </p>

<p>This is not the first time I've been obsessed with collecting certain things. I have a very extensive Coca Cola collection. Don’t ask me how I got into that one, cause even I can’t pinpoint where it came from, but I also started collecting Coca Cola stuff around 13/14 years old. I now have well over 200+ items in my collection, mostly on display in my childhood bedroom, but I have brought some over to my apartment to show off. Like Pokemon, buying Coca Cola stuff, especially older collectible items, is expensive. I could make some more money by selling some of my collection, but I’m afraid I would have trouble parting ways with my items. All in all, my hobbies are expensive, but the dopamine rush and the beauty of it all makes it well worth it. </p>
